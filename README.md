# Algorithm Catalog
With this repository I am keeping track of what I feel are important algorithms I have worked through. I will do my best to add all problem descriptions, sample input & output, as well as pseudo implementation with time/space complexities. It is a work in progress started in July 2019. I hope to utilize this repo as a reference guide as well as a way to keep track of my own progress while studying and practicing algorithm challenges.
